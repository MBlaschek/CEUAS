The files called e.g. 'ncar_stationIds_filename.dat' contains the name of the file names analized by the build_311c_Inventories 
script, and the associated primary_id.
In fact, in the station_configuration files, one can only retireve the primary and secondary station ids, but not the original file
to which the ids are associated. 
This is information is however required, since when we merge the station data,
we need to access the proper original file to compare the data from the various sources, for a given identified station.

When merging the station, the source of each record must be specified; the CDM has this possiblity already implemented inside the 
header_table: 
- source_id
- source_record_id
- duplicates 


Also the index variable should store the index of the record in the ORIGINAL file, so that it can be accessed
