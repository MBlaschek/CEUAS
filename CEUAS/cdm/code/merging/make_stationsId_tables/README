This directory contains:

- script extract_stationId_with_filename.py.
This loops over all the files in the seven datasets orignal directoris (note: using thfiles in LEO scratch directories)
And makes a CSV table where the first entry is the station id, then auxilliary data,
and the name of the file from which the data was taken.

With this, you can fidn out which station data (e.g. Moscow) is split between several files:
different files, i.e. with the same identified station_id, must be merged together since they refer to the same station.

- directory: tables created by running the above script over all the datasets
