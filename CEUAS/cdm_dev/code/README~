- Modified some paths. Now the script can be called as
  python3 build_311c..._.py and it finds the correct paths. Need to check if what we want.

- Implemented reading the .csv files form the url of the GitHub page (see ~ line 490)

- Working with the 3188 db:
  the station_cnfiguration file does not exist. I do not know how to create it.
  I do not have writing permission to /leo/scratch
  I am using the /1/station_configuration.dat file instead  

- Fixed all era5 dbs




code for reference: 
   ~leo/python/readodbstationfiles_new.py

--- starting with bufr data

/raid60/scratch/leo/scratch/era5/odbs/ai_bfr/


the code I am looking at
   par_read_bufr_stn_nofeedback
uses the function
   codes_bufr_new_from_file

which I do not know where to find.
I only found a .cpp code in Rasotools,
but I dont have reading acces to it.
So I don't know what to do with it
