*** CDM_Format_BuiltInDict.py
Contains a preliminary version of the file, 
where the dictionary was extracted by hand from the documents on GitHub.


##### The current version to be used is:

***  CDM_Reader.py
This version of the file reads the data of selected variables from the tables downloaded from the CDM 
GitHub repository.
For now, only the variables specified in the lists in the file are read and the information retirevd from the
original GitHub files.
The variables implemented are the ones used in the readodbstations script (still incomplete list).

This can be extended easily to include all the variables in the original GitHub files,
however they do are not necessarily used somewhere for our scope.

The script also included a utility to print a nice latex table.
