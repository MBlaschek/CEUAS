Added the script plotAll_u_v_wind.py 
It plots all the u,v components of the converted netCDF file
Plot are stored in /raid8/srvx1/federico/odb_netCD/PLOTS

Must check the data since all the components are positevely defined


*** 13/03/2019
- added new readodbstation file to convert from odbs to netCDFs.
It processes correctly the datasets 1 , 1759, 1761 and produced the netCDF files with temperature, u and v wind components

Still to do: add humidity, dew point
(see Michael scripts to convert humidity)

- updated plotAll_u_v_wind


ToDo: add a module to check file 
i.e. print list of files with empty data, 
     small datasets, 
     compare u and v vectors etc. 


*** readodb Humidity
The file is a copy of the readodbstationfiles, with the addition of the changes to implement the specific Humidity.

The major change was the extension of the metadata dictionary,
and the interpolation function to extract the standard pressure level values.


*** 21/03/2019

readodb Humidity has been extended with the dew point.
Tested with the station 10393
See attached pdf output

*** 22/03/2019
Updated the read_Humidity file sicne it was not storing correctly the pressure level for large values.
I added the range in the settattr function in the readstationfiles_t
