Added the script plotAll_u_v_wind.py 
It plots all the u,v components of the converted netCDF file
Plot are stored in /raid8/srvx1/federico/odb_netCD/PLOTS

Must check the data since all the components are positevely defined

ToDo: add a module to check file 
i.e. print list of files with empty data, small datasets, comapre u and v vectors etc.
