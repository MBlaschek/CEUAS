*** 07/03/2019
Added the script plotAll_u_v_wind.py 
It plots all the u,v components of the converted netCDF file
Plot are stored in /raid8/srvx1/federico/odb_netCD/PLOTS

Must check the data since all the components are positevely defined


*** 13/03/2019
- added new readodbstation file to convert from odbs to netCDFs.
It processes correctly the datasets 1 , 1759, 1761 and produced the netCDF files with temperature, u and v wind components

Still to do: add humidity, dew point
(see Michael scripts to convert humidity)

- updated plotAll_u_v_wind


ToDo: add a module to check file 
i.e. print list of files with empty data, 
     small datasets, 
     compare u and v vectors etc.
