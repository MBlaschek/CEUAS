# Introduction 
*
This README explains the content of the test_dir directory,
that includes the main scripts and relative information to:
1. convert the odb file to netCDF files
   (u,v wind , temperature-t, dew point temperature-dp, relative humidity-rh) 
2. plot the data from the netCDF files for u,v wind, t, dp, rh
3. process the netCDF files and calculate, when possible,
   the dp and rh from t,rh and t,dp if available,
   and create a 'combined' version of the file
4. make plots to check the combined values
