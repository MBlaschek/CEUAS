0,1,geopotential,upper_air,geopotential,m2 s-2,Geopotential is the sum of the specific gravitational potential energy relative to the geoid and the specific centripetal potential energy.
1,2,temperature,upper_air,air_temperature,K,"Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air, not the surface (skin) temperature."
2,3,wind,upper_air,eastward_wind,m s-1,"""Eastward"" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal)                                                           air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name upward_air_velocity.)"
3,4,wind,upper_air,northward_wind,m s-1,"""Northward"" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal)                                                           air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name upward_air_velocity.)"
4,7,humidity,upper_air,specific_humidity,1,"""specific"" means per unit mass. Specific humidity is the mass fraction of water vapor in (moist) air."
5,29,humidity,upper_air,relative_humidity,1,actual water vapor pressure devided by saturation vapor pressure over water times hundred
6,59,humidity,upper_air,dew_point_temperature,K,Dew point temperature is the temperature at which a parcel of air reaches saturation upon being cooled at constant pressure and specific humidity.
7,111,wind,upper_air,wind speed,m s-1,"Speed is the magnitude of velocity. Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component.                                                           (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name upward_air_velocity.) The wind speed is the magnitude of the wind velocity."
8,112,wind,upper_air,wind_from_direction,degree,"Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component.                                                           (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name upward_air_velocity.) In meteorological reports,                                                           the direction of the wind vector is usually (but not always) given as the direction from which it is blowing (wind_from_direction)                                                           (westerly, northerly, etc.). In other contexts, such as atmospheric modelling, it is often natural to give the direction                                                          in the usual manner of vectors as the heading or the direction to which it is blowing (wind_to_direction) (eastward, southward, etc.)                                                           ""from_direction"" is used in the construction X_from_direction and indicates the direction from which the velocity vector of X is coming."
