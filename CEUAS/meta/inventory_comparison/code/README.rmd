def AddDistance(self):

Latitude and longitude consistency in time is checked in the following way.
A list is created extracting all the possible distinct pairs [lat,lon] from the input file.
This list consists in just one entry if the values are constant in time, while it can be longer if the station was
relocated or there the coordinates were recorded in different format/precision.
In this case, we check if the absolute difference between the minimum and maximum value of the latitude or longitude is below
0.2 degrees. If so, there is no need to consider different location, but the coordinate pair of the most recend data is used.
