# In situ temperature, wind and humidity from 1905 to present from radiosondes

according to `In situ <variables> from <period> from <sources>`

previously called: `Comprehensive network for upper-air temperature, relative humidity and wind observations`

The Copernicus Early Upper Air Sub-daily Data set is designed to contain all available upper air data from radiosondes and PILOT balloons prior to 1979. It is organised in station time series of records on significant levels, where they can be on height or pressure levels in the source data sets, and where they are on significant pressure levels in the merged data sets. Main data sources are the NCAR and NCEI upper air data sets as well as data collected at ECMWF during operational assimilation activities. Data collected during the ERA-CLIM and ERA-CLIM2 projects are another important data source. The source data sets are the basis for a merged data set, which is subject to strict quality control in order to choose the best available source in case of duplicates. The merged data set is then homogenised in order to reduce systematic errors, which helps to reduce also the overall observation errors. These are estimated using Desroziersâ€™ method if background and analysis departure information from reanalyses available. The homogenisation method is mainly based on analysing background departure time series from reanalyses, as established in the literature. Users can download the source data, the merged and adjusted merged data, as well as the bias and uncertainty estimates. While data on significant levels are not that convenient to use due to their varying record length, they are uniquely suited for calculating climatologies of e.g. tropopause height, Convective Available Potential Energy or precipitable water. The merged data set is supposed to be the cleanest and most complete upper air data set available for assimilation before 1979 but also for climate research. Data for the period after 1979 are available as well, since they are needed for the used homogenisation method anyway, and can be compared with harmonised upper air data as provided by the C3S 311a Lot3 service. The data content is also available in more integrated form in the companion monthly data set , which contains gridded fields calculated from the station data, which can be directly compared to other gridded data such as reanalyses or satellite products. The user should also be aware of an additional historical radiosonde inter-comparison data set ,which provides unique opportunities to diagnose systematic errors between radiosonde types.
